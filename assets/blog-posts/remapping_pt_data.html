      I am currently finishing up school so I don't have a lot of free time to
      work on my showcases but I am slowly working on it. I have a few more
      projects that I will be adding soon. Here is a sample of what I'll be
      showcasing. If you want to know more about my work experience and what I
      have built, check back to this page soon or reach out to me to disucss it.

    Here I will be describing a sizable portion of my master's research, which
    involved taking gene and genetic data from the marine diatom
    <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em> and accurately updating their coordinates
    to determine where they belong on an updated genome assembly.
