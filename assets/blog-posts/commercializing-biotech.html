    Here I will be describing a feasibility study I performed for a potential
    biotech start-up for a novel drug sensing technology. I'll be writing about
    why and how I started doing this, where it's led to so far, and what I've
    gained through this experience. I will be touching upon the things I learend
    relating to intellectual property rights, financial considerations, and the
    start-up ecosystem relating to the biotech industry.
