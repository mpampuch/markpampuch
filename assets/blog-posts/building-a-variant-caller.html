      I am currently finishing up school so I don't have a lot of free time to
      work on my showcases but I am slowly working on it. I have a few more
      projects that I will be adding soon. Here is a sample of what I'll be
      showcasing. If you want to know more about my work experience and what I
      have built, check back to this page soon or reach out to me to disucss it.

    for DNA sequencing to detect real mutations in a DNA sample and distinguish
    them from sequencing errors. I'll be describing the process of building a
    machine learning model to perform this task and the challenges I faced along
    the way. I'll also be discussing the results of the model and how it can be
    improved. dataset derived from a breast cancer study.
