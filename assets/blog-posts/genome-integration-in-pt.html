      Improving Nuclear Genome editing in
      <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em>

    A sizable portion of my master's research involved developping methodologies
    for improving integrattion of transgenic DNA in the marine diatom
    <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em> in the pursuit of create stable genomic
    landing pads.

  <p class="blog-post_paragraph">
    As a breif overview of the project, engineering photosynthetic microbes has
    been a proposed method for sustainably producing natural resources without
    causing further harm to our planet. One candidate microbe for this purpose
    is called
    <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em>. By engineering this microbe, researchers
    have been able to use it to produce chemicals involved in creating plastics,
    pharmaceuticals, and even COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Many genetic tools have
    been developed for this microbe to make engineering easier, however one of
    the bottlenecks that has limitted this microorganism's potential for
    industrial use was the lack of reliable methods for integrating transgenes
    into its nuclear genome.

    I have been able to establish a simple, efficient, and reliable protocol to
    introduce custom DNA into this organism's genome. I've also analyzed the
    method of integration and stability of the transgenes in the genome. This
    work lays the groundwork for developing reliable insertion sites and
    targeted nuclear genome engineering techniques in this promising
    microorganism.
