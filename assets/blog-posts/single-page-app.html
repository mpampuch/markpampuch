  </div>
  <p class="blog-post_paragraph">
    As part of my bioinformatics education, I have been learning about how to
    develop applications with user-friendly interfaces that can be used by
    biologists to analyze their data. This has led me down the road of learning
    about web development technologies. I have learned JavaScript and its
    various frameworks, specifically those in the
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)"
      target="_blank"
    >
      MERN stack </a
    >. Here I have built a single-page application, which is a web application
    that does not need to reload the page when the user interacts with it. This
    makes the application feel more like a desktop application than a web
    application. This application is built with React, a JavaScript library for
    building user interfaces.

    The application I built is a manager app for internal use at hospitals. The
    user can manage appointments, hospital rooms, and view statistics about the
    cash flows of the hospital.
