      Building a Bioinformatics Web Application with React
    </p>
  </div>
  <p class="blog-post_paragraph">
    As part of my bioinformatics education, I have been learning about how to
    develop applications with user-friendly interfaces that can be used by
    biologists to analyze their data. This has led me down the road of learning
    about modern web development technologies. I have learned JavaScript and its
    various frameworks, specifically those in the
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)"
      target="_blank"
    >
      MERN stack </a
    >. Here I have built a single-page application, which is a web application
    that does not need to reload the page when the user interacts with it. This
    makes the application feel more like a desktop application than a web
    application. I built this to learn React (a JavaScript library for building
    user interfaces) and other facets of modern web programming.

  <p class="blog-post_paragraph">
    The application is a restriction digest analysis tool that allows biologists
    to analyze DNA sequences by identifying potential cutting sites for
    restriction enzymes. I was inspired to do this when I faced a similar
    challenge during my masters research and realized there wasn't a
    user-friendly tool available to scan for suitable restriction enzymes that
    both cut a desired sequence of interest but don't cut another specific
    sequence. Users can input custom DNA sequences in FASTA format, select from
    a comprehensive database of restriction enzymes, and receive detailed
    analysis results including fragment sizes and cutting positions.

      >This app is hosted with the free tier of Render Cloud platform. The free
      tier of render cloud platform will stop the server if there is no traffic
      to it for a while. If incoming traffic comes after this server is stopped,
      it will need to boot up again. This means that sometimes when you press
      the link, you may need to wait up to 2 minutes for the website to load.
      Just be patient.

  <p class="blog-post_paragraph">
    The application uses a single container architecture where the React
    frontend is built and served as static files by the Node.js backend, which
    also executes Python scripts for the actual DNA analysis. This creates a
    seamless user experience where biologists can perform complex bioinformatics
    analysis through a simple web interface.
