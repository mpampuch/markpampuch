  </div>
  <p class="blog-post_paragraph">
    As part of my bioinformatics education, I have been learning about how to
    develop applications with user friendly interfaces that can be used by
    biologists to analyze their data. This has led me down the road of learning
    about web development technologies. I have learned JavaScript and its
    various frameworks, specifically those in the
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)"
      target="_blank"
    >
      MERN stack </a
    >. Here I have built a single page applicaiton, which is a web application
    that does not need to reload the page when the user interacts with it. This
    makes the application feel more like a desktop application than a web
    application. This application is built with React, a JavaScript library for
    building user interfaces.

  <p class="blog-post_paragraph">
    The application I built is a manager app for internal use at hospitals. The
    user can manage appointments, hospital rooms, and view statistics about the
    cash flows of the hospital.
