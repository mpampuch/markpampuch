      Remapping <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em> genetic data between two
      different genome assemblies
    </p>

  <p class="blog-post_paragraph">
    Here I will be describing a sizable portion of my master's research, which
    involved taking gene and genetic data from the marine diatom
    <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em> and accurately updating their coordinates
    to determine where they belong on an updated genome assembly.

    As a breif overview of the project, engineering photosynthetic microbes has
    been a proposed method for sustainably producing natural resources without
    causing further harm to our planet. One candidate microbe for this purpose
    is called
    <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em>. By engineering this microbe, researchers
    have been able to use it to produce chemicals involved in creating plastics,
    pharmaceuticals, and even COVID-19 diagnostic tests. One of the issues with
    researching this organism is that all the genetic and expression data that
    was known for this organism was generated based off a genome assembly that
    was built in 2008. A more complete genome assembly was developped in 2021
    showing that the previous assembly was incomplete and that the genetic data
    generated from it was not mapped to accurate locations in the genome.

    I have been able to identify the correct location of 56,624 out of 69,070
    genes and gene-like features in this organism's genetic code and have
    provided potential reasons for each of the remaining 12,446 features as to
    why finding out where they are actually located within the organism's DNA is
    a challenge. This work lays the groundwork for future researchers to further
    explore the functionality and regulation of the identified genes and
    gene-like features, thereby enhancing our understanding of the organism's
    biology.
